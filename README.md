# Web Vitals Component

A small Custom Element to watch web vitals for Lighthouse V6.

Currently only watches LCP, CLS, and FID.

## Put on website

This is how I put it onto my webpage:

```html
<web-vitals>
	<script async defer src="path/to/java/script"></script>
</web-vitals>
```

But if you find a better way, please let me know :blush:
